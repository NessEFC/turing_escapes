# An existing user that has one previous order
# As an authenticated user
# When I visit "/orders"
# Then I should see my past order
# And I should see a link to view that order
# And when I click that link
# Then I should see each item that was order with the quantity and line-item subtotals
# And I should see links to each item's show page
# And I should see the current status of the order (ordered, paid, cancelled, completed)
# And I should see the total price for the order
# And I should see the date/time that the order was submitted
# If the order was completed or cancelled
# Then I should see a timestamp when the action took place
